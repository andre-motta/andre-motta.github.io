I also develop software solutions for other companies at Oceansoft as the acting CTO. Before coming to NC State, I finished my BsC in Computer Science at the Computer Science Department at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais from Aug. 2015 to July. 2019, where I worked with Dr. Olga Nikolaevna, mainly focusing on market prediction using machine learning, and Dr. Adriano Veloso working mainly with text mining on the judicial system. I was a software engineering intern at Hexagon Mining, a machine learning engineer intern at CSU Cardsystem and worked as a software engineer at Jr MendonÃ§a",
